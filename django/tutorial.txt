Installing Django :-
Step1 :- we need to create a virtual enviorment
         open terminal and write :-
           python -m venv venv 
Step 2:- This will create a virtual enviorment named 'venv'
         Now move within the venv
         cd venv
         and write :- 
         .\Scripts\Activate
         this will activate the venv and after activating
         write :- pip install django
         And to check version write :- 
         django-admin --version




#Setup a newproject in django:-
for this we need to start our venv by running command :- .\Scripts\Activate within our venv folder
then write code :- django-admin startproject mysite
This will create a folder named mysite inside that u will get a folder same name which contains
file as follows:-
__init__.py 
asgi.py
settings.py
urls.py
manage.py


# Starting wed dev server in Django
Within our dev folder we get a file named 'manage.py' which is
responsible to start our developement server.
To start our server write following code in terminal :-
python manage.py runserver
This will provide you a localhost link like :- http://127.0.0.1:8000/

** let's say we are working on various project at a time and we start server all togther
   then port can be a problem so for that we can use custom port number by writing port 
   number after runserver like this:-
   python manage.py runserver 4444


# Project Structure in Django Project
 1. to run project we use manage.py file.
 2. django use a default database as soon we migrate through project named as 'dq.sqlite3'.
 3. we always get a subfolder with same name of our django project which contains app files and
    it also refer as app folder.
 4. let's create a templates folder which will contains all html file for future use.
 5. also we need to create a folder static name which contains css, js and images for our app.
 6. also create a media name folder which contains dynamic content
